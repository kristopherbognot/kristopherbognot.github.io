  <br>
  <br>
  <p>Analytical, Result-driven Professional with a passion for People, Data, and Business. Looking to bring creative value and big picture thinking to a group of like minded professionals in order to contribute to a company's long-term success.
  <br>
  <br>
    With a desire to help and grow people, Kris believes in work ethic and that any task you do no matter how large or menial it may seem, do it all to the best of your ability. He never stops learning, and pushes the boundaries of progress with ACTIVE and CREATIVE thinking.
  <br> 
  <br> 
    As a motivated self-starter Kris has worked hard to refine his skills in the subjects of personal development, leadership, communication and statistical analysis. Kris is currently pursuing his continuing education to enhance his expertise in SQL, R-Programming, Python and other RDBMS in order to harness the potential behind Big Data Analytics. 
  <br> 
  <br> 
    "I believe that Big Data holds the missing pieces of untapped potential for companies and society to get to the next level of progress. The ability to read and decipher all this data into strategic action plans allow businesses and people to harness trends, move and predict markets, and even stop bad business before it gets out of control. Couple that with the ability to lead and manage lines of business, teams, or just people in general. This formula would truly give one the opportunity to affect great change in a positive way."
  <br>
  <br>
    Personal Goal:
    As I venture into the next stage of my life, I look forward to bringing my analytical, problem solving and proactive communication skills to the business place and cultivate new relationships. I pledge that no matter where I end up, to do everything to the best of my abilities and most importantly with respect and integrity. I welcome the challenge to flourish in a fast paced work environment in which I can broaden my horizons and expand on learning and growing any new skills demanded of me in order to further unlock my potential.
